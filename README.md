# Air quality monitoring via The Things Network(TTN)

This project is conducted in Hochschule Ravensburg Weingarten in Summer 2018 as a study requirements of Embedded Computing Project.

LoRA WAN stands for Long Range Wide Area Network. LoRa enables long-range transmissions (more than 10 km in rural areas) with low power consumption. LoRa uses license-free sub-gigahertz radio frequency bands like 433 MHz, 868 MHz (Europe), 915 MHz (Australia and North America) and 923 MHz (Asia). Due to its low power, long range transmission capability(generally more than 1okm in rural areas) it is used in different types of industries to connect IoT (Internet of Things) devices.
